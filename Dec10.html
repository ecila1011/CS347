    <p>If I were to be teaching this course next semester, there are only a few things 
        that I may do a bit differently. First, I think that I would either make the readings 
        into quizzes or have students submit small programs before each class, especially with the chapters 
        that have more concrete examples. I would continue to do in class labs because I think they 
        were very useful in learning the material. I also like the idea of splitting the course 
        up into two different courses to better be able to focus on the two major topics of the class, being 
        HTML and CSS, and JS and React. I think this would give a lot more opportunity for learning 
        and a deeper understanding of materials. Other than that, I really enjoyed the classes content 
        and structure and think that this was a fun and useful course to take!
