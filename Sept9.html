    <p>
        I looked up some cool things that you can do with CSS and I found an
        <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/features/css-tricks-to-revolutionise-your-layouts" target="_blank">article</a>
        with some demos about using css for collage and I though it was really cool. (heres the link
        or that). I really enjoy looking at and creating art, and seeing it created with code that we have 
        been learning about in class was really interesting. There weren't a whole lot of details about how they
        created the collages, so I did some further research to find something that I could try out.

        After doing some further googling, I found this <a href="https://css-tricks.com/clipping-masking-css/" target="_blank">article</a>
        about clipping and masking and I found the part about making an animation/transition using 
        clip-path. This article did include some code, that I used as a reference
        to implement my own little transition. The article used images of Harry
        Potter to demonstrate all of their techniques however I chose to use a picture of a cat because
        I thought it was cuter. The code was surprisingly simple and I liked the way that the little animation
        came out. I think this is a cool aspect of css, and the functions built into the language make it very easy
        to implement.

    <p>Here is my css code sample, I made the url shorter here in my example for space sake.</p>

    <pre>
div {
    width: 280px;
    height: 280px;
    background: url(https://assets.rebelmouse.io) center center;
    background-size: cover;
    transition: 0.4s cubic-bezier(1, -1, 0, 2);
    clip-path: circle(15%);
  }
  div:hover {
    clip-path: circle(50%);
  }
    </pre>

    <p>And here is what my little transition/animation looks like, hover over the circle to see it in action.</p>
    <div></div>
