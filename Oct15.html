    <h1>10/15/2021 Blog Entry</h1>

    <p> This week I decided to implement something similar to what I did last week, but that would
        actually work. My blog post last week made a typewriter style animation using css. This week
        I used a different example from the same 
        <a href = "https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/typewriter-effect/"> article </a> to create 
        a type writer style animation that actually works. The way that the type-writer function worked
        using css was to hide parts of the text and slowly reveal it, to give the illusion that
        it was being typed. With this javascript version, it actually adds and removes letters and 
        looks more realistic. It also allows for the backspacing effect. I think that it turned out 
        very cool. I didn't change anything on the javascript side of the example, but I did mess with 
        a bit of the formatting in the css file. I did however read through the javascript code and 
        add comments so that I could try and understand what is going on for everything. Overall, 
        Javascript has proven to have quite the learning curve but between the labs and looking at coded 
        examples like this one, I am slowly but surely learning.
    </p>

    <p> Here is the animation that I made for this weeks blog. There are five different phrases that will appear.
    </p>

    <h2>
        <a href="" class="typewrite" data-period="2000" data-type='[ "Hi, my name is Alice.", "I am a programmer.", "I am an artist.", "I love to code.", "I love to crochet" ]'>
          <span class="wrap"></span>
        </a>
      </h2>

<p> Here is the code in my Javascript file that I used to create the animation above. I added comments so 
    that I could try and understand what the example was exactly doing at each point. Some of it was 
    still a bit hard to follow, but adding the comments did help me to slow down and actually try to understand 
    the code and what exactly it is doing.

    // this will initilaize some varibles needed in the tick function
    var TxtType = function(el, toRotate, period) {
        this.toRotate = toRotate;
        this.el = el;
        this.loopNum = 0;
        this.period = parseInt(period, 10) || 2000;
        this.txt = '';
        this.tick();
        this.isDeleting = false;
    };
    
    // this is the function that actually controls the display and deletion of the text
    TxtType.prototype.tick = function() {
        var i = this.loopNum % this.toRotate.length;
        var fullTxt = this.toRotate[i];
    
        // changes text value depending on whether we are adding or deleting
        if (this.isDeleting) {
        this.txt = fullTxt.substring(0, this.txt.length - 1);
        } else {
        this.txt = fullTxt.substring(0, this.txt.length + 1);
        }
    
        // I think that this is for formatting
        this.el.innerHTML = '<span class="wrap">'+this.txt+'</span>';
    
        // initialize some delta to use for the timeout funciton
        var that = this;
        var delta = 200 - Math.random() * 100;
    
        if (this.isDeleting) { delta /= 2; }
    
        // I think that this is used to smooth out the animation and/or make it 
        // seem a bit more realistic and not as stiff
        if (!this.isDeleting && this.txt === fullTxt) {
        delta = this.period;
        this.isDeleting = true;
        } else if (this.isDeleting && this.txt === '') {
        this.isDeleting = false;
        this.loopNum++;
        delta = 500;
        }
    
        // set the timeout before going back to the function to display the next phrase
        setTimeout(function() {
        that.tick();
        }, delta);
    };
    
    // This function executes when the browser loads the object
    window.onload = function() {
        var elements = document.getElementsByClassName('typewrite');
    
        // for every element i in the class typewrite
        for (var i=0; i < elements.length; i++) {
    
            // gets the current element of the data array for the given element i
            var toRotate = elements[i].getAttribute('data-type');
            var period = elements[i].getAttribute('data-period');
    
            // if toRotate is not null, send it to get typed
            if (toRotate) {
              new TxtType(elements[i], JSON.parse(toRotate), period);
            }
        }
    
        // implement CSS
        var css = document.createElement("style");
        css.type = "text/css";
        css.innerHTML = ".typewrite > .wrap { border-right: 0.08em solid #fff}";
        document.body.appendChild(css);
    };
