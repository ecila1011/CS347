    <h1>11/12/2021 Blog Entry</h1>
    <p>I really liked the way I chose to do last weeks blog post,
        where I found a tutorial online and followed it to make a react app. 
        I am still beyond lost when it comes to all of this, but I feel like walking through 
        examples both in the labs in class as well as these tutorials on my own are helping. 
        The <a href = "https://www.akashmittal.com/reactjs-sample-project-step-by-step/"> tutorial </a>
         I found this week was a component that created a burger display. It was rather 
        simple and straight forward, but still was a bit challenging in places to figure out simply 
        because I barely know what I'm doing. I think that this little example has a potential to be 
        expanded on for my next blog post. Some way that I can take in user input to create the burger. 
        Whether it be the number of different ingredients or their order or both. I could have attempted 
        it for this blog post, however I think it would end up being a lot for today. So I'm hoping that 
        next week, with a bit more understanding of how to use react, I can expand this example.
    </p>

    <p>I created seperate JS files for each of the burger ingredients, and each had its 
        own css file to create the image for that ingredient. Then, I had a Create Burger file 
        that took in an object from the App.js to create the burger itself, and then displayed it.
        I have included both the important parts of the App.js file and the CreateBurger.js file, since 
        they contain the bulk of the code.

    <p>App.js</p>
    <pre>
        function App() {

            return (
              &lt;div className="App">
                &lt;h1>Choose Your Burger Ingredients&lt;/h1>
                &lt;CreateBurger
                  burgerStack={[
                    'Lettuce',
                    'Tomatoes',
                    'Cheese',
                    'Lettuce',
                    'Burger',
                    'Tomatoes',
                    'Tomatoes'
                  ]}
                />
              &lt;/div>
            );
          }
    </pre>

    <p>CreateBurger.js</p>
    <pre>
        export default function CreateBurger(props) {
            const BurgerStack = props.burgerStack.map((item, index) => {
              switch (item) {
                case 'Cheese':
                  return &lt;Cheese key={index} />;
                case 'Lettuce':
                  return &lt;Lettuce key={index} />;
                case 'Burger':
                  return &lt;Burger key={index} />;
                case 'Tomatoes':
                  return &lt;Tomatoes key={index} />;
                default:
                  return null;
              }
            });
          
            return (
              &lt;div>
                &lt;BreadUpper />
                {BurgerStack}
                &lt;BreadLower />
              &lt;/div>
            );
          }
    </pre>
