      <h1>9/3/2021 Blog Entry</h1>
      <p>I have no experience with HTML, so this week has already been a huge learning curve. I didn't know how 
          to create a webpage, and I thought it was a lot more complicated than what I have seen so far. I realize 
          that we have only really scratched the surface, but I am excited to be able to learn more as the semester goes on.
          I like that I am able to see what the code does visually, and my friends who have no idea what half of my CS 
          code does can actually look at my website and understand what I am working on. I'm a fairly creative person and 
          I enjoy organizing my webpage and adding new functions to it. There is definitely a big learning curve to it and I 
          have a lot to learn still, but I am already excited for the semester.
