    <h1>11/5/2021 Blog Entry</h1>

    <p> This week I decided to look a tutorial for react so that I could try to get a better
        understanding of how it works. I had some trouble with the lab we did in class today and I wanted
        to make sure that I understood what exactly we did so that I won't be as lost (hopefully) going forward.
        I found <a href = "https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html"> this tutorial </a> from reactjs that walks 
        you through creating a tic tac toe game. I really liked it because it went more in depth than other articles
        I have found for these blogs in the past. It walked me through each part and slightly changed things at each level
        rather than just jumping right to the end. It supplied me with some code to work with at the beginning, and then
        walked through all of the steps and was specific about how everything interacted with each other. It definitely
        helped me understand things a lot more, but this stuff is still quite confusing to me. I liked this style of blog
        and I think it was beneficial for me to use a tutorial since I definietly need a lot more hand holding for this kind
        of coding at least at this stage in learning it. the square function and board class of my code
        from the tutorial is included below.
    </p>

<p> This function controls each square of the tic tac toe board. It itself is maintained by the Board class. This method in
    particular was changed a lot throughout the tutorial, and was rather interesting to see how it interacted with the board. At first
    it was its own class and had its own constructor and render functions, but as the tutorial went on, all of those necessary
    state changes were passed up to the board.
</p>

<pre>
    function Square(props) {
        return (
            &lt;button 
                className="square"
                onClick={props.onClick}>
                    {props.value}
                &lt;/ button&gt;
        )
    }
</pre>

<p>This is the board class. This controls the square class as well as the overall 
    state of each of the squares. It also takes care of calculating the winner, by calling another
    function that I did not include here. 
</p>

<pre>
    class Board extends React.Component {

        constructor(props) {
            super(props);
            this.state = {
                squares: Array(9).fill(null),
                xIsNext: true,
            };
        }
    
        handleClick(i) {
            const squares = this.state.squares.slice();
            if (calculateWinner(squares) || squares[i]) {
                return;
            }
            squares[i] = this.state.xIsNext ? 'X' : 'O';
            this.setState({
                squares: squares,
                xIsNext: !this.state.xIsNext,
            });
        }
    
        renderSquare(i) {
          return (
            &lt;Square 
                value={this.state.squares[i]} 
                onClick={ () => this.handleClick(i)}
                /&gt;
          );
        }
      
        render() {
          const winner = calculateWinner(this.state.squares);
          let status;
          if (winner) {
            status = 'Winner ' + winner;
          } else {
            status = 'Next player: ' + (this.state.xIsNext ? 'X' : 'O');
          }
      
          return (
            &lt;div>
                &lt;div className="status">{status}</div>
                &lt;div className="board-row">
                        {this.renderSquare(0)}
                        {this.renderSquare(1)}
                        {this.renderSquare(2)}
                    &lt;/div>
                    &lt;div className="board-row">
                        {this.renderSquare(3)}
                        {this.renderSquare(4)}
                        {this.renderSquare(5)}
                    &lt;/div>
                    &lt;div className="board-row">
                        {this.renderSquare(6)}
                        {this.renderSquare(7)}
                        {this.renderSquare(8)}
                    &lt;/div>
                    &lt;/div>
          );
        }
      }
