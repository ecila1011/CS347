    <h1>12/3/2021 Blog Entry</h1>

    <p> This week I chose to look into some more <a href = "https://css-tricks.com/recreating-the-apple-music-hits-playlist-animation-in-css/" > css tricks </a>
        and fun things that I didn't use earlier in the semester. We haven't really focused as much on css at this point in the class, but I think that it 
        will be a bit helpful to the project, and it is easier for me to understand at the moment than react and I 
        wanted to learn something fun that didn't also stress me out. The animation that I made is very straight-forward 
        but I think it is cool especially with the timing of things as well as the changes in opacity. Css still amazes me and all of 
        the cool animations that it can do. I think that learning css was one of my favorite units this semester, and I think that it would be a lot of fun 
        to continue experimenting with it. I especially liked that some people use it as an art form, which combines to things I am very passionate about: programming and art.

    <p>Here is the animation that I was able to create using the code below. 
    </p>

    <div class="container">
        <div class="content">
        </div>
        <div class="box"></div>
        <div class="box"></div>
        <div class="box"></div>
        <div class="box"></div>
        <div class="box"></div>
        <div class="box"></div>
        <div class="box"></div>
        <div class="box"></div>
        <div class="box"></div>
        <div class="box"></div>
      </div>
    

<p> Here is the code in my css file that I used to create the animation above.

    body {
        display: grid;
        place-items: center;
        height: 100vh;
      }
      
      .container {
        background: #eb7feb;
        border-radius: 16px;
        display: grid;

        overflow: hidden;
        place-items: center;
        position: relative;
        width: 385px;
      }
      
      .box {
        --delay: 1s;
        animation: grow 10s linear infinite;
        animation-delay: var(--delay);
        background: #471e45;
        height: 100px;
        opacity: 0.5;
        position: absolute;
        width: 100px;
      }
      .box:nth-child(2) {
        --delay: 2s;
      }
      .box:nth-child(3) {
        --delay: 3s;
      }
      .box:nth-child(4) {
        --delay: 4s;
      }
      .box:nth-child(5) {
        --delay: 5s;
      }
      .box:nth-child(6) {
        --delay: 6s;
      }
      .box:nth-child(7) {
        --delay: 7s;
      }
      .box:nth-child(8) {
        --delay: 8s;
      }
      .box:nth-child(9) {
        --delay: 9s;
      }
      .box:nth-child(10) {
        --delay: 10s;
      }
      
      @keyframes grow {
        from {
          opacity: 0.5;
          transform: scale(0);
        }
        to {
          opacity: 0;
          transform: scale(3.85);
        }
      }
