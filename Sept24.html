    <h1>9/24/2021 Blog Entry</h1>

    <p> I wanted to find something cool using css that I could potentially use in my project.
        I've looked at animations before for my blog posts, but none seemed like they would be something
        useful enough for my website. So I went looking for something a bit different and found this
        <a href = "https://uxplanet.org/10-lifesaving-html-css-tricks-for-designers-11bbf76729eb"> article </a>
        It showed some sample code for how to make an animation for some words that seemingly appeared from
        nowhere. I thought that was a cool technique so I copied the code and then tried to expand it
        a bit and played with some other ways for the words to appear. It wasn't anything too crazy technical,
        but it gave me a good jumping off point for some animations that I could utilize for my project.
    </p>
    <p> Here is my little animation that I made </p>

<div class = "parent1">
    <div class = "child1" >
        oh
    </div>
</div>

<div class = "parent2">
    <div class = "child2" >
        hello
    </div>
</div>

<div class = "parent3">
    <div class = "child3" >
        there
    </div>
</div>

<p> Here is the code in my css file that I used to create the animations above. Again, nothing too 
    crazy difficult but I like that it is relatively straightforward so that it will be easy to implement if I 
    choose to use it for my project.
</p>

<pre>
/* oh */
.parent1 {
    height:5em;
    overflow-y: hidden;
    display: block;
    }

.parent1 .child1 {
    animation-name: appear;
    animation-duration: 5s;
    font-size: 5em;
    }

@keyframes appear {
    from { transform: translateY(1.8em) }
    to { transform: translateY(0) }
    }

/* hello */
.parent2 {
    height:5em;
    overflow-y: hidden;
    display: block;
    }
    
.parent2 .child2 {
    animation-name: slide;
    animation-duration: 5s;
    font-size: 5em;
    }
    
@keyframes slide { 
      from { transform: translateX(-1.8em) }
      to { transform: translateX(0) }
    }

/* there */
.parent3 {
        height:5em;
        overflow-y: hidden;
        display: block;
        }
        
.parent3 .child3 {
        animation-name: appearup;
        animation-duration: 5s;
        font-size: 5em;
        }
        
@keyframes appearup {
          from { transform: translateY(-1.8em) }
          to { transform: translateX(0) }
        }
