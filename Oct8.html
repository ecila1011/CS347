    <h1>9/24/2021 Blog Entry</h1>

    <p> I did not have enough time this week as I would've liked to be able to properly
        do some research and find something to work on. I found this <a href = "https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/typewriter-effect/"> link </a> 
        and decided to try and make an animation that acted like a type-writer. For some reason it
        is giving me issues and won't appear as though it is being typed. I triple checked
        that my code matched the example, and it still did not work for some reason. I will
        include my code below and what the animation does. Currently, only the cursor works. 
        Although I just don't have enough time to continue messing with this today, 
        I'm thinking that I can devote more time to it next week, and also try and implement
        it using js. There was a js example in the same link that I found that I want to use as a 
        guide but also expand on a bit more. I am unfamiliar with js and am rusty on using
        java, so I'm excited to figure this example out in css and then see how it can be
        implemented using js.
    </p>

    <p>Here is the animation that I was able to create using the code below. Only the cursor
        seems to be animated and I can't figure out how to make it appear as though it is being typed.
    </p>

    <div class="typewriter">
        <span>Hello! I am a type-writer!</span>
      </div>

<p> Here is the code in my css file that I used to create the animation above. 
</p>

<pre>
    .typewriter span {
        color: #262626;
        overflow: hidden;   
        border-right: .10em solid #FF8D8D;
        white-space: nowrap;   
        margin: 0 auto;   
        letter-spacing: .4rem;   
        animation: typing 3s steps(30, end), cursor 1s step-end infinite;
        animation-fill-mode: forwards;
      }
      @keyframes typing {
        from { width: 0 }
        to { width: 100% }
      }
      
      @keyframes cursor {
        from, to { border-color: transparent }
        50% { border-color: #FF8D8D }
      }
</pre>
