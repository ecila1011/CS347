        <h1>9/17/2021 Blog Entry</h1>
        <p> This week I decided to look into how to animate certain 
            elements using css and I found an <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/features/css-tricks-to-revolutionise-your-layouts" target="_blank">article</a>
            that had a lot of details about the different animation elements. I expanded one of the examples in the article
            that took a square and changed its color and moved it in a square formation. I kept the colors of the square
            but I added more keyframes and changed where the square ended up at each point. It reminded me of the DVD loading screen
            so I tried to make it act sort of like that. That ended up being a little more complicated than I anticipated, simply because the
            speed would change depending on where exactly the square was going and from where. I could have accounted for this but it would
            have taken some more calculations than I had the time for. Overall, I'm glad that I was able to learn this technique and I hope
            that I can find a place for it in project 1.

            Here is the code that I used to create the animation:
        </p>
        <pre>
            .background {
                background-color: blue;
                width: 300px;
                height: 300px;
            }
            
            .square {
                width: 100px;
                height: 100px;
                background-color: blueviolet;
                position: relative;
                animation-name: example;
                animation-duration: 5s;
                animation-timing-function: linear;
                animation-iteration-count: infinite;
                animation-direction: alternate;
              }
            
              @keyframes example { 
                    0%   {background-color:red; left:100px; top:0px;}
                    10%  {background-color:yellow; left:200px; top:40px;}
                    20%  {background-color:blueviolet; left:150px; top:200px;}
                    30%  {background-color:green; left:0px; top:100px;}
                    40%  {background-color:red; left:100px; top:200px;}
                    50%  {background-color:yellow; left:200px; top:100px;}
                    60%  {background-color:blueviolet; left:130px; top:200px;}
                    70%  {background-color:green; left:0px; top:120px;}
                    80%  {background-color:red; left:100px; top:0px;}
                    90%  {background-color:yellow; left:200px; top:100x;}
                    100% {background-color:blueviolet; left:200px; top:0px;}
                  
              }
            </pre>


            <p> Here is the little animation that this css code implemented </p>
            <div class = "background">
                <div class = "square">
                </div>
            </div>
    

      </body>
